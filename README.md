## Disclaimer
The assignment states as a bonus to use Volvo's VCC-UI library. That library is used, although not extensively throughout the application. The reason for this is that as more and more VCC-UI components were added to the application, more erratic behavior started to occur. Like random page elements reordering without any user interactions, and inconsitent rendering results.

The library's documentation does not provide any information regarding this, nor any complete examples of an application using the library (the examples link in the documentation is broken).
